# üöÄ Azure Data Engineering Project

## üß† Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **Data Engineering Pipeline** built on Microsoft Azure.  
It covers every stage from data ingestion, transformation, and storage to serving and visualization using modern Azure tools.

### **Data Flow**
1. **Data Source:** Raw data is extracted from external sources (API, CSV, or database).
2. **Azure Data Factory:** Ingests and orchestrates data pipelines to move raw data into Azure Data Lake.
3. **Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Raw Zone):** Stores the ingested raw data securely for further processing.
4. **Azure Databricks:** Performs transformations and data cleaning using PySpark notebooks.
5. **Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Processed Zone):** Stores transformed and curated data.
6. **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Acts as a data warehouse, enabling fast SQL queries on the transformed data.
7. **Power BI:** Connects to Synapse Analytics to visualize business insights and KPIs.

## üß© Pipeline Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion
- Data Factory copies raw data from the source into the **Raw Zone** of the Data Lake.  
- Pipelines are scheduled to run daily or triggered automatically.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation
- Databricks Notebook is used to clean and transform the raw data.  
- Example tasks:
  - Remove duplicates and null values
  - Change data types
  - Aggregate or join multiple datasets
  - Save output in Delta or Parquet format

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
- The transformed data is written to the **Processed Zone** in Azure Data Lake Gen2.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Serving
- Azure Synapse Analytics reads data from the processed zone.  
- SQL queries are created to prepare datasets for reporting.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
- Power BI connects to Synapse using a SQL endpoint.  
- Interactive dashboards and reports are built for data insights.
